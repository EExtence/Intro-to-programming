Green Eggs and Ham
The Raven
By Dr. Seuss
By Edgar Allen Poe
I am Sam, I am Sam, Sam-I-Am.
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore.
That Sam-I-Am! That Sam-I-Am! I do not like that Sam-I-Am.
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
Do you like green eggs and ham?
��Tis some visitor,� I muttered, �tapping at my chamber door� Only this and nothing more.�
I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
Eagerly I wished the morrow.
Would you like them here or there?
Vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow�sorrow for the lost Lenore.
I would not like them here or there.
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore� Nameless here for evermore.
I would not like them anywhere.
And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me�filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating ��Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.
I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.
Would you like them in a house?
This it is and nothing more.�
Would you like them with a mouse?
Presently my soul grew stronger.
I do not like them in a house.
Hesitating then no longer, �Sir,� said I, �or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore.
I do not like them with a mouse.
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you.�
I do not like them here or there.
Here I opened wide the door.
I do not like them anywhere.
Darkness there and nothing more.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.
I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, �Lenore?� This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, �Lenore!�.
Would you eat them in a box?
Merely this and nothing more.
Would you eat them with a fox?
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
Not in a box. Not with a fox.
�Surely,� said I, �surely that is something at my window lattice.
Not in a house. Not with a mouse.
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore.
I would not eat them here or there.
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore.
I would not eat them anywhere.
�Tis the wind and nothing more!� 
I would not eat green eggs and ham.
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door.
Would you? Could you? In a car?
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door� Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Eat them! Eat them! Here they are.
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling.
I would not, could not, in a car.
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
You may like them. You will see.
�Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,� I said, �art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore.
You may like them in a tree!
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night�s Plutonian shore!�
I would not, could not in a tree.
Quoth the Raven �Nevermore.�
Not in a car! You let me be.
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,Though its answer little meaning�little relevancy bore.
Could you, would you, with a goat?
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door.
I would not, could not with a goat!
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as �Nevermore.�
Would you, could you, on a boat?
But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
I could not, would not, on a boat.
Nothing farther then he uttered�not a feather then he fluttered.
I will not, will not, with a goat.
Till I scarcely more than muttered �Other friends have flown before.
I will not eat them in the rain.
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.�
Not in the dark! Not in a tree!
Then the bird said �Nevermore.�
Not in a car! You let me be!
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, �Doubtless,� said I, �what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore.
I do not like them in a box.
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of �Never�nevermore�.�
I do not like them with a fox.
But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door.
I will not eat them in a house.
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore.
I do not like them with a mouse.
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking �Nevermore.�
I do not like them here or there.
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom�s core.
I do not like them anywhere!
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion�s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o�er, But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o�er, She shall press, ah, nevermore!
I do not like green eggs and ham!
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.
�Wretch,� I cried, �thy God hath lent thee�by these angels he hath sent thee Respite�respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore.
You do not like them. So you say.
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!�
Try them! Try them! And you may.
Quoth the Raven �Nevermore.�
Try them and you may, I say.
�Prophet!� said I, �thing of evil!�prophet still, if bird or devil!.
Sam! If you let me be,
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted.
I will try them. You will see.
On this home by Horror haunted�tell me truly, I implore.
(... And he tries them ...)
Is there�is there balm in Gilead?�tell me�tell me, I implore!�
Say! I like green eggs and ham!
Quoth the Raven �Nevermore.�
I do! I like them, Sam-I-Am!
�Prophet!� said I, �thing of evil!�prophet still, if bird or devil!
And I would eat them in a boat.
By that Heaven that bends above us�by that God we both adore.
And I would eat them with a goat...
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
And I will eat them, in the rain.
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore.
And in the dark. And on a train.
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.�
And in a car. And in a tree.
Quoth the Raven �Nevermore.�
They are so good, so good, you see!
�Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!� I shrieked, upstarting.
So I will eat them in a box.
�Get thee back into the tempest and the Night�s Plutonian shore!
And I will eat them with a fox.
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
And I will eat them in a house.
Leave my loneliness unbroken!�quit the bust above my door!
And I will eat them with a mouse.
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!�
And I will eat them here and there.
Quoth the Raven �Nevermore.�
Say! I will eat them anywhere!
And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door.
I do so like green eggs and ham!
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon�s that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o�er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor.
Thank you! Thank you, Sam-I-Am.
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted�nevermore!
